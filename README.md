Final Project Details

This project was intended to mimic the process of interviewing a client that had intentions of introducing an online system for their business. The Business, DriverPass, offers a service to customer's that planned to take their Driver's License test from the DMV. Their offerings included an online lesson and testing platform to prepare for the written portion of the DMV test as well as in-person driving test. The client wanted to introduce the online system to provide a platform for customer's to log into their account, the system to generate reports based on changes made, reservation management, store client and company data, etc. The customer wanted to pursue a cloud-based solution to handle back-end maintenance and architecture for their system. 

One part of this project I thought I did particularly well at was with illustrating the various diagrams. I thought I did particularly well with following appropriate conventions and illustrating the various ways activities could be performed on the system. One such case was with the Activity Diagram for restting a user's password and purchasing a package from the DriverPass system. 

If there were one part of the project I would do over, it would probably be the system design document. I struggled with understanding what exactly I was supposed to be doing or to what level of detail I was meant to show. The UML Class diagram also got really messy, as I wasn't sure how mcuh I was supposed to be including in the illustration of the system and such. 

Understanding the user's needs is essential to system design. One part of the project involved an interview with the owner and their IT Admin. I referenced this several times throughout the project to make sure I was recognizing what they wanted the system to be able to do - such as the user resetting their password, the system logging changes, and have appropriate permissions set for each user that accesses it. 

Software design can take many shapes and forms, but I would start with a requirements document to understand what is needed in the first place. This helps confirm what the client needs before moving onto the actual system design. Usually, after the system is designed, development would begin in an iterative manner, which would lead to testing and appropriate testing and documentation is reached next.
